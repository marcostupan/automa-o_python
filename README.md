Hi Everyone!

This simple automation uses Python to input data from a CSV archive into an online stock system.

The step-by-step used (logic) was:
1 - Enter on the enterprise ERP (using chrome).
2 - Log in to the ERP (stock ERP)
3 - Import the database (CSV) (using pandas)
4 - Input the data of 1 product.
5 - Repeat the operation until the end of the stock list.

If you want to use this example, you welcome!

PS: there are comments in the code for easy interpretation.
